Alternative Header 1
====================

Alternative Header 2
--------------------

Syntax includes:

* *italics*
* **bold**
* ***bold and italics***
* __underlines__
* >!spoilers!<
* ~~strike outs~~
* *__you can mix and match BTW__*
* {noparse spans are literal. *this won't be rendered* and Steam will show literal [i]}

{{{
Noparse can also be used in block form.
This can be useful if you want to demo Steam syntax.
For example, [i]italicizes[/i] text.
}}}

```
code can only be a block.
Because that's how Steam works.
```

1. List can be ordered
2. like this
3. Lists can contain complex syntax as long as it's indented properly. For example:
   * see how this is aligned with the rest of the text.
10. It should always be aligned.
    * like this.

> quotes must have spaces after the {> }
> This is to avoid conflicts with >!spoiler!< syntax.
